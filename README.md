## Assignment presentation

- Share the link to your [GIThub repo through this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfxecmTdXXWplnhHvUgooEjpvjqJZm_wehC9nhdEmTO5D15og/viewform).
- Make sure the repo contains a paper presenting your assignment.
- The practical assignment has to reside in a branch named CGW.

## Operations on texture coordinates

Scale and rotate a texture around user specified point.

## Requirements

Use sources from Practical assignment #2 adding new functionality as follows:

- Map the texture over the surface from practical assignment #2.

- Implement texture scaling (texture coordinates) scaling / rotation around user specified point- odd variants implement scaling, even variants implement rotation.

- It has to be possible to move the point along the surface (u,v) space using a keyboard. E.g. keys A and D move the point along u parameter and keys W and S move the point along v parameter.

## Paperwork

Prepare a digital report that holds:

- a title page;

- a chapter describing the task (1 page);

- a chapter describing theory (2 pages);

- a chapter describing the implementation details (2 pages);

- a chapter of user's instruction with screenshots (2 pages);

- a sample of source code (2 pages).

> Add report to Git branch
