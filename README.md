## Assignment presentation

- Share the link to your [GIThub repo through this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScoUirUwyzq6ESy9k-R6EcT6IhBb_z4q4xZZhpSpQT2xJEUHA/viewform).
- Make sure the repo contains a paper presenting your assignment
- The practical assignment has to reside in a branch named CGW.

## Spatial audio

Implement spatial audio through [WebAudio HTML5 API](https://www.w3.org/TR/webaudio/).

## Requirements

- Reuse the code from practical assignment #2
- Implement sound source rotation around the geometrical center of the surface patch by means of tangible interface (the surface stays still this time and the sound source moves)
- Reproduce your favorite song in mp3/ogg format having the spatial position of the sound source controlled by the user
- Visualize position of the sound source with a sphere
- Add a sound filter (use BiquadFilterNode interface) per variant
- Add checkbox element that enables or disables the filter.
- Set filter parameters according to your taste.

## Paperwork

Prepare a digital report that holds:

- title page;
- chapter describing the task (1 page);
- chapter describing theory (2 pages);
- chapter describing the implementation details (2 pages);
- chapter of user's instruction with screenshots (2 pages);
- sample of source code (2 pages).

> Add report to Git branch CGW
