## Assignment presentation

- Share the link to your [GIThub repo through this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSerrWyQJ3o7jnl24gI7dtnYtCqPE1xh0eAAQnqcwZXydrt9MQ/viewform).
- The practical assignment has to reside in a branch named PA1.
- Make sure the repo contains several screenshots presenting your assignment and a photo of yourself wearing anaglyph glasses (without this photo the assignment is treated as unsuccessful).

## Requirements

- You need to develop the software delivering anaglyph stereo image of a model.
- Use the surface from Visualization of graphic data and geometric information credit module.
- Make sure the surface has some visual details (e.g. wireframe + filled polygons) or a texture on top.

The surface has to be rendered in negative parallax while the video from the camera in zero parallax.

It has to be possible:

- to rotate the model around its center of mass using a mouse.
- to change Eye separation parameter
- to change Field of View
- to change Near Clipping distance
- to change Convergence distance
